            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hey there stranger, welcome! My name is Ralph de Groot, and I’m the founder of My Codeless Website.</p>

            <p>10 years ago I built my first website, it was a website for a startup I was excited about. 10 years
                later, that startup is dead. But I did get something out of it – a true passion for web design.</p>

            <p>In the years that passed, I got asked by many friends and family to help them with their website. And
                guess what, a few months later I got approached by more and more people. I was making a living as a
                freelance web designer in the upcoming years. And it was great!</p>

            <p> I’ve made hundreds of websites throughout these years, honestly, I lost track at some point.</p>

            <p>Throughout this journey, I was always looking for inspiration. It’s just something that gets me started.
            </p>

            <p>Every time I built a website for a client, I looked for inspiration online. If I was building a website
                for a dentist, I wanted to have a quick look at how other dentists designed their website.</p>

            <p>But searching for good-looking web design took me hours and hours. Then it hit me. I probably wasn’t the
                only one that needed some good web design inspiration.</p>

            <p>That’s why I started My Codeless Website.</p>

            <p>This blog is made for web designers and small business owners who want to build a new website or improve
                their current one.</p>

            <h1>Traveling the world while building websites </h1>
            <p>Ever since I started my career as a web designer I’ve had one non-negotiable contract item with any web
                design client. I’m working remotely. In fact, it’s one of the things I love the most about web design.
            </p>

            <p>I’ve worked while traveling in South America, Asia, and even Africa. In fact, I think web design and
                traveling have a lot of similarities. You need to go from A to B, but there are endless ways of how you
                do it. I love the freedom in both!</p>

            <p>I started My Codeless Website on my own, but that’s not the case anymore. Our team is based in Utrecht at
                Ganzenmarkt 6, in the Netherlands. Do swing by if you’re ever around!</p>

            <p>Before I end this (long) about me page, a quick summary of what you’ll find on this website.</p>

            <p>In other words, everything you need to know to be visible online.</p>
